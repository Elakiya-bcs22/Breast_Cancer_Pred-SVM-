🩺 Breast Cancer Prediction — SVM Classifier

A Python-based machine learning project that uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict whether a tumor is benign 🟢 or malignant 🔴.
This project demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and predictions using real-world medical datasets.

⚙️ Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Elakiya-bcs22/Breast_Cancer_Pred-SVM-.git
cd Breast_Cancer_Pred-SVM-


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

🚀 Usage

Train the SVM model:

python train.py


Run predictions with new input samples:

python app.py

✨ Features

🧠 Implements a Support Vector Machine for tumor classification.

🔄 Workflow: Data Preprocessing → Model Training → Inference.

📘 Beginner-friendly & modular structure.

🔧 Easy to extend with hyperparameter tuning or kernel variations.

📈 Future Improvements

🔍 Try different kernels (rbf, poly, sigmoid).

📊 Use feature scaling and dimensionality reduction (PCA).

🧪 Compare performance with other classifiers (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.).

✅ Conclusion

The SVM model achieves strong performance in classifying tumors as benign 🟢 or malignant 🔴.
With more data, feature engineering, and kernel tuning, you can improve accuracy and robustness.
